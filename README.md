## üöÄ Quick Start (No Setup Required)

**Try it immediately!** The app runs in demo mode by default - no API keys needed. All AI features work with realistic sample data perfect for testing and development.

## AI Provider Configuration

This project supports multiple AI providers for easy switching and cost optimization:

### Demo Mode (Default - No API Keys Required)
- **Demo Provider**: Works immediately with realistic sample responses
- Perfect for development, testing and showcasing features
- No rate limits or API costs

### Free Options
- **Hugging Face**: 1,000 requests/day free
- **Cohere**: 100,000 tokens/month free
- **OpenAI**: Limited free tier

### Setup

1. **For Demo Mode (Default)**: Just run the app - no configuration needed!

2. **For Real AI**: Choose your AI provider by setting `AI_PROVIDER`:
\`\`\`bash
AI_PROVIDER=demo        # Default - no API key needed
AI_PROVIDER=huggingface # Free tier - 1000 requests/day
AI_PROVIDER=cohere      # Free tier - 100k tokens/month
AI_PROVIDER=openai      # Paid service
\`\`\`

3. Add the corresponding API key (only if not using demo):
\`\`\`bash
# For Hugging Face (recommended for prototypes)
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_token

# For OpenAI (if you have credits)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

# For Cohere (good free tier)
COHERE_API_KEY=your_key
\`\`\`

### Getting Free API Keys

- **Hugging Face**: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens (Free - 1000 requests/day)
- **Cohere**: https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys (Free - 100k tokens/month)
